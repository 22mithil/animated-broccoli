    "plot_summary": "In the chaotic aftermath of Thanos's snap, the Avengers grapple with failure and confront Thanos, who reveals he destroyed the Infinity Stones. Five years later, profound grief persists, but the unexpected return of Scott Lang offers a new hope. He proposes time travel using the Quantum Realm, persuading a reluctant Tony Stark and Bruce Banner to develop the necessary technology. The team prepares for a perilous 'Time Heist' to retrieve Infinity Stones from past locations like Asgard and New York, establishing strict rules for time travel. During the mission, Nebula confronts her past, Loki is encountered, and ethical dilemmas arise. Natasha Romanoff tragically sacrifices herself on Vormir for the Soul Stone, intensifying the heroes' grief and sense of responsibility. In the climactic battle against Thanos and his forces, Tony Stark makes the ultimate sacrifice, wielding the Infinity Gauntlet to defeat the villain. Captain America then embarks on a solo mission to return the Infinity Stones, choosing to live a full life in the past before returning as an old man to pass on his mantle. Thor departs with the Guardians of the Galaxy, signaling both immense loss and a hopeful new beginning.",
