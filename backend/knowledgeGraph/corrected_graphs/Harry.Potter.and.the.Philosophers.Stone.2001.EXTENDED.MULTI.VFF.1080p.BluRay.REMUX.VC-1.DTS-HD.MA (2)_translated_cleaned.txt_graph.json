    "year": 2001,
    "plot_summary": "Professor McGonagall, Professor Dumbledore, and Hagrid somberly deliver the infant Harry Potter to his neglectful Muggle relatives, the Dursleys, acknowledging his destined fame and the tragedy of his parents' recent deaths. Ten years later, Harry experiences accidental magic, like unintentionally freeing a snake at the zoo, while enduring a deprived life and receiving mysterious letters addressed to his cupboard. On his eleventh birthday, Hagrid bursts in, revealing Harry's wizard identity and the true, magical circumstances of his parents' demise. Hagrid then guides a wide-eyed Harry through the bustling Diagon Alley, where he accesses his inherited fortune and gathers essential Hogwarts supplies. Harry's journey culminates in selecting a unique wand that shares a peculiar connection to his parents' killer, setting him on a wondrous yet mysterious path.\n\nHarry Potter is given significant revelations about his past, including that Voldemort killed his parents and gave him his famous scar. He visits Ollivander's, where he obtains his wand and learns of its unsettling connection to Voldemort's. Harry then boards the Hogwarts Express, befriending Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger during the journey. Upon arrival at Hogwarts, the first-year students, including a nervous Harry, are sorted into their houses, with Harry, Ron, and Hermione all joining Gryffindor. The segment concludes with the new students exploring the magical castle, encountering ghosts, and preparing for their studies with a mix of wonder, excitement, and lingering mystery.\n\nThe segment details the early school experiences of students, including Harry Potter, Ron Weasley, and Hermione Granger, at Hogwarts. They are introduced to various professors and ghosts, begin classes like Potions and Flying, and Harry is notably recruited as Gryffindor's youngest Quidditch Seeker due to his exceptional flying skills. However, tensions rise when Ron inadvertently upsets Hermione, who then faces a dangerous encounter with a troll in the girls' bathroom, requiring Harry and Ron's intervention. Their bravery leads them to discover a mysterious three-headed dog guarding a trapdoor on a forbidden floor, hinting at a larger secret.\n\nRon's insensitive comments cause Hermione distress, leading her to cry in a bathroom that a rogue troll subsequently invades. Harry and Ron bravely rush to her rescue, using a spell Hermione taught them to defeat the troll, an act that earns them both a scolding and house points. Following this incident, the trio grows suspicious that Professor Snape facilitated the troll's entry as a diversion to access a mysterious object guarded by a three-headed dog. Harry then receives an invisibility cloak and discovers the Mirror of Erised, which shows him his deceased parents, prompting Professor Dumbledore to explain its allure and warn against its deceptive nature. The segment concludes with the friends' continued investigation, including a Quidditch match where Snape appears to jinx Harry's broom, reinforcing their belief that he seeks the guarded item, which they eventually link to the alchemist Nicolas Flamel.\n\nAfter Malfoy curses Neville, leading to detention for him, Harry, Ron, and Hermione, the trio discovers the Philosopher's Stone, learning it grants immortality and is guarded by a three-headed dog named Fluffy. Growing suspicious that Snape intends to steal the Stone for a weakened Voldemort, Harry encounters a figure drinking unicorn blood in the Forbidden Forest, revealed to be Voldemort by a centaur named Firenze. Realizing Dumbledore is away and Hagrid was tricked into revealing Fluffy's weakness, the friends decide they must retrieve the Stone themselves. After immobilizing Neville, who tries to stop them, they sneak to Fluffy, bypass him as he's asleep from an enchanted harp, and fall through the trapdoor into a Devil's Snare, which Hermione quickly defeats with light.\n\nThis segment follows Harry, Ron, and Hermione as they face perilous magical challenges, including escaping a Devil's Snare and navigating a room of flying keys. During a life-sized game of wizard's chess, Ron bravely sacrifices himself, allowing Harry to proceed alone. Harry then confronts Professor Quirrell, who shockingly reveals himself to be possessed by Lord Voldemort, attempting to obtain the Philosopher's Stone from Harry using the Mirror of Erised. Harry resists Voldemort's manipulative offers and ultimately defeats Quirrell through the protective power of his mother's love, leading to the Stone's destruction. The segment concludes with a triumphant Dumbledore awarding last-minute points for the trio's and Neville's courage, securing the House Cup for Gryffindor, as the friends bid farewell to Hogwarts for the summer.",
