    "year": 1997,
    "plot_summary": "A modern deep-sea expedition led by Brock Lovett explores the sunken Titanic wreck, searching for the 'Heart of the Ocean' diamond. An elderly survivor, Rose Calvert, comes forward, identifying herself as the young woman in a drawing found by Lovett's team. Rose recounts her 1912 experience aboard the maiden voyage of the Titanic as Rose DeWitt Bukater, an aristocratic woman trapped by her prearranged life and fianc\u00e9, Cal Hockley. Concurrently, a free-spirited artist, Jack Dawson, and his friend Fabrizio win third-class tickets, boarding the ship with exuberance. Rose attempts suicide but is saved by Jack, sparking an unlikely, forbidden romance that defies rigid class distinctions and the disapproval of Cal and Rose's mother, Ruth. Despite repeated ice warnings, the Titanic accelerates, leading to its fatal collision with an iceberg. As the ship is declared fatally damaged, Cal cruelly frames Jack for theft, leading to his arrest. Rose, defying her family, abandons a lifeboat to rescue Jack from the rapidly flooding lower decks. Amidst widespread panic and insufficient lifeboats, they navigate the sinking vessel. In a profound act of sacrifice, Jack ensures Rose's survival by giving her the only available floating debris. Rose survives the catastrophe, fulfilling her promise to Jack by living a full life under the name 'Rose Dawson' and keeping his memory and their love a secret, the 'Heart of the Ocean' diamond remaining a symbol of their enduring bond.",
