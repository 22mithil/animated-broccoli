    "plot_summary": "Harry Potter's second year at Hogwarts is marred by mysterious petrifications and a chilling message: 'The Chamber of Secrets was opened.' With his friends Ron and Hermione, Harry investigates, brewing Polyjuice Potion to question suspects and delving into the legend of Salazar Slytherin. Harry discovers he can speak Parseltongue, leading to suspicion that he is Slytherin's heir. He uncovers the truth through Tom Riddle's diary, revealing Riddle framed Hagrid 50 years prior. As the school faces potential closure and Ginny Weasley is abducted, Harry confronts the spectral Tom Riddle, who reveals his identity as Lord Voldemort, in the Chamber of Secrets. Harry slays the Basilisk with the Sword of Gryffindor and destroys Riddle's diary with a basilisk fang, saving Ginny and vanquishing Voldemort's memory. The school is restored, petrified victims are healed, Hagrid returns, and Harry ingeniously frees the house-elf Dobby.",
