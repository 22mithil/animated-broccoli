    "plot_summary": "The film introduces Harry Potter, an orphan living with his abusive aunt and uncle, who discovers on his eleventh birthday that he is a wizard and has been accepted to Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. He learns about his parents' murder by Lord Voldemort and his own fame for surviving the attack as a baby. Guided by Hagrid, Harry visits Diagon Alley to prepare for Hogwarts, where he meets Ron Weasley and Hermione Granger on the Hogwarts Express. At Hogwarts, they are sorted into Gryffindor House. Harry quickly becomes the Seeker for the Gryffindor Quidditch team. The trio soon uncover a plot surrounding a mysterious object, the Philosopher's Stone, which is hidden within Hogwarts and guarded by various magical challenges. They initially suspect Professor Snape is trying to steal it for Voldemort, who is clinging to life. After a series of adventures including a detention in the Forbidden Forest where they encounter a cloaked figure drinking unicorn blood, they realize Professor Quirrell is possessed by Voldemort. Harry, Ron, and Hermione navigate the forbidden obstacles, including Fluffy the three-headed dog, Devil's Snare, enchanted flying keys, and a life-sized Wizard's Chess game, to reach the Stone. Harry confronts Quirrell/Voldemort, who is defeated by Harry's mother's protective magic. Dumbledore explains the Stone's destruction and the power of love. Gryffindor ultimately wins the House Cup, and Harry finds a true home and family at Hogwarts.",
