    "plot_summary": "Following the devastating events of Thanos's snap, the surviving Avengers grapple with immense loss and despair. Stranded in space, Tony Stark and Nebula face their impending demise but are eventually rescued. Back on Earth, the team confronts their collective failure, leading to a desperate pursuit of Thanos, only to discover he has destroyed the Infinity Stones. Five years later, the world is desolate, and remaining heroes, including Captain America and Black Widow, try to cope. The unexpected return of Scott Lang from the Quantum Realm introduces the possibility of time travel, reigniting a glimmer of hope. Despite initial reluctance, especially from a grief-stricken Tony Stark who has built a new family, the heroes, including Smart Hulk, begin to develop and test a method for quantum realm time travel to reverse the snap and bring back those they lost. This effort involves recruiting other heroes like Clint Barton (Ronin) and Thor.",
